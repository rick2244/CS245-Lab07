# CS245-Lab07
This lab was more difficult than I expected. The main problem I ran into after figuring out how to output the right combinations with 0 included in my linked list. After I figured out how to get ride of skip 0 from my linked list it was much easier. The next difficult was making sure that the second half printed when the opertion {2} is called.
